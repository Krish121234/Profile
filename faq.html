        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Who are you, and what’s your background?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Krish Bhoite, an 18-year-old who finished high school in 2024. I’m currently on a gap year to focus on preparing for my next academic chapter at university.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What inspired you to start streaming/studying publicly?</h2>
            <p>I stream my study sessions on YouTube because I want to do something meaningful with my time and motivate others to stay focused. Many people struggle with attention spans today due to the rise of short-form content, and I aim to break free from those distractions while helping others do the same.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What are you currently studying or preparing for?</h2>
            <p>I’m currently preparing for the JEE exams to get into a reputed tech university. Alongside this, I also enjoy studying topics like coding, programming, AI, and machine learning. While I find coding and tech fascinating, I can’t say the same about my JEE prep—it feels less relevant to my future goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What’s your dream university and course?</h2>
            <p>Honestly, I don’t have a specific dream university. I believe success depends more on how I use opportunities than the university name. Of course, getting into a top-tier institution would help, but my main focus is studying computer science, wherever that may be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What are your favorite coding languages or technologies?</h2>
            <p>I really enjoy Python—writing code in it feels so intuitive and fun! I’ve also dabbled in web development with HTML and CSS, mostly for learning purposes. Recently, I completed a basic machine learning course, and it confirmed my interest in diving deeper into AI/ML. I’m also excited to experiment with Raspberry Pi and similar compact devices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What do you do in your free time?</h2>
            <p>I used to spend a lot of time scrolling through reels and YouTube, but I’ve replaced that habit with something much more fulfilling—reading. I’ve grown to love fiction novels and philosophical books. Occasionally, I also watch content about the latest technological advancements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Why did you start a YouTube channel?</h2>
            <p>I created my YouTube channel to help me stay accountable during study sessions and to support others who might find it hard to study alone. It’s a way to connect and build a community of learners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What motivates you to keep going when things get tough?</h2>
            <p>My biggest motivation is my mother. She’s a single parent and an incredibly hardworking person. Whenever I feel down, I remind myself of her sacrifices, and that pushes me to keep striving for success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What’s your favorite book, and why?</h2>
            <p>I absolutely loved The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka! It’s a beautifully written novella that explores the darker sides of human relationships. It made me realize how conditional most forms of love are, showing how people’s attitudes change when you stop being “useful” to them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What’s your biggest challenge right now?</h2>
            <p>My biggest challenge is staying focused on JEE prep. I’ve tried really hard, but I often feel burned out and disconnected from subjects like physics, chemistry, and advanced math. It’s not about being lazy—I’ve just lost interest in topics that don’t align with my goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What are your career goals?</h2>
            <p>I want to delve into artificial intelligence and machine learning and eventually create a product that will benefit students, making learning more efficient and accessible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Do you have any tips for staying focused while studying?</h2>
            <p>Avoid loud music or songs with lyrics, as they can distract you. Instead, try soft instrumental music, lo-fi beats, or even ambient sounds like birds chirping. Also, keep your phone as far away as possible unless you absolutely need it for studying.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How do you manage stress during intense study periods?</h2>
            <p>I rely on timed breaks, a cup of coffee, and calming music to recharge during tough study sessions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What’s something unique about you?</h2>
            <p>I’ve recently discovered my love for building communities! I run a Discord server where my community and I study together, set goals, and motivate each other. I also enjoy creating personalized playlists—it’s a fun way to express myself and share my vibe with others.</p>
