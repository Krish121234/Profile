        <p>Hello! I've been going through some sort of mental block from last few weeks. I'm unable to focus on my studies or follow a routine... and this is the absolute worst time for this to be happening! i've got my JEE mains second attempt in a month and im not sure that i will be able to score well in it. The January attempts results are already in and i scored very bad in it... even worse than last year! </p>
Im deciding to lock tf in for next month and do my best in the second attempt! I'm pretty sure that i wont get in to a tier 1 university, but i still have hope for a tier 2 uni. 

<p>Study plan for next month- <br>
-wake up at 6 a.m. <br>
-Start first session at 6:30a.m.<br>
-break fast + shower from 9:30a.m. to 11a.m.<br>
-Session 2 from 11:15a.m. to 1p.m.<br>
-Lunch from 1p.m. to 1:45p.m.<br>
-Session 3 from 2p.m. to 4:30p.m. (with small breaks in-between)<br>
-Rest from 4:30p.m. to 5p.m.<br>
-Session 4 from 5p.m. to 7p.m.<br>
-Dinner 7p.m. to 8p.m.<br>
-Session 5 from 8:15p.m. to 10p.m.<br>
-Sleep</p>

<p>Am i sure, im gonna be able to follow this routine? No. Am i gonna give my best to follow it? Yes! 
If i start facing tiredness/ sleepiness while following this routine, i will probably tweak it a bit. 
Thats it for this blog! Thanks</p>
