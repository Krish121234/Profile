        <p>Hello! My name is Krish Bhoite.</p>
        <p>I’m an 18-year-old guy trying to figure out what I want to do in life. My interests lie in technology, so I’m planning to study computer science next year.</p>
        <p>This blog is mostly going to be about me—my thoughts, experiences, and maybe a few surprises along the way. 😉</p>
        <p>The past year has been a mix of happiness, sadness, and some complicated feelings I still can’t quite put into words. I learned a lot, accomplished a few things I’m proud of, but also faced setbacks. I didn’t get into a university, and I lost touch with many of my high school friends. But despite all that, I discovered something important—I love technology. I love tinkering, coding, and especially web development.</p>
        <p>Over the past year, I explored different things. I did an internship in tech, experimented with painting and art, wrote a lot of code, learned Python, and even built Discord bots. It’s been a journey of trial and error, but I think I’m starting to find my path.</p>
        <p>This is just the beginning. Let’s see where it goes.</p>
