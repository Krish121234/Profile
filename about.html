        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Krish Bhoite, and I'm an 18-year-old student on an exciting journey of self-discovery and growth. 
            After graduating high school in 2024, I decided to take a gap year to prepare for university and focus on my passion 
            for coding, programming, and artificial intelligence. My dream is to create impactful technology and contribute to 
            the world of machine learning and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from studying, I enjoy reading philosophical and classic novels, experimenting with coding projects, and sharing 
            my study sessions online to inspire and connect with like-minded learners. I'm always looking for ways to grow, whether 
            it's improving my technical skills, sharpening my focus, or building meaningful communities where people can learn and 
            thrive together.
        </p>
